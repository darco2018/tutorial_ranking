Just one example is the Guadalupe-Nipomo Dunes Preserve, 18 miles of Earth's most biodiversity coastal dune-lagoon ecosystem. Activities include camping, hiking, horseback riding, boating and bird watching. The tour package includes 2 nights of camping and 3 days admission to the park of your choice. We can also arrange for RV rentals. This is a great package for families who want to pass down a great experience and an education to the next generation, while participating in preserving a part of their future.",
